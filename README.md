Objective:
The objective of a landing page is to convert visitors into leads or customers by encouraging them to take a specific action, such as signing up for a service, making a purchase, or subscribing to a newsletter. Landing pages are designed with a clear and focused purpose, often promoting a single product, service, or offer.

Overview:
A landing page is a standalone web page created for a specific marketing campaign or promotion. Unlike a homepage, which serves as the main entry point to a website and provides general information about a business, a landing page is designed to capture the visitor's attention and prompt them to take action. It typically contains concise and compelling content, a prominent call-to-action button, and minimal distractions to guide the visitor towards the desired conversion goal. Landing pages are often used in online advertising campaigns, email marketing, and social media promotions to drive targeted traffic and maximize conversion rates.
